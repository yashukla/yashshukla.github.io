	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>Hi there, my name's Yash. I'm passionate about making science and technology accessible for everyone.
		To me, a product has a shot at success when anyone can understand why it matters. Throughout my
		past work in computer science, engineering, and most recently medicine, I've always worked
		to make sure my team never loses sight of why what we're doing is important. Let's build
		something great together!</p>

	<h2>What I’m Up To</h2>

	<p>Currently, I’m a student at the University of Saskatchewan, completing a B.Eng in
		Engineering Physics and a B.Sc in Computer Science in December 2019. I'm a founder of <a href="http://soteriamedtech.com">Soteria Medtech</a>, a company spun out
		of the <a href="https://research.usask.ca/innovation-enterprise/programs/summer_entrepreneurs.php">Summer Entrepreneurs</a>
		program at the U of S, and I also work part-time at <a href="https://research.usask.ca/innovation-enterprise/">Innovation Enterprise</a>
		as a <a href="https://research.usask.ca/innovation-enterprise/programs/student-engagement.php">Student Innovation and Business Analyst</a>.</p>

	<p>Aside from classes, I’m also involved with my university’s biomedical engineering group,
		<a href="http://www.saskinvent.ca">SaskInvent</a>, as Project Leader, along
		with having served as Recruitment Director and Sponsorship Director in the past.
		I’ve also worked in several research labs, spanning <a href="http://madmuc.usask.ca/">computer science</a>,
		<a href="https://engineering.usask.ca/departments/biomed.php">engineering</a>, <a href="https://artsandscience.usask.ca/physics/facilities/isas.php">
		physics</a>, and <a href="https://medicine.usask.ca/department/schools-divisions/biomed/biochemistry,-microbiology-and-immunology.php">
		biochemistry</a>. </p>

	<h2>What I Do for Fun</h2>

	<p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling, theatre, reading, and a good cup of tea. I like to keep
		up with the innovation and entrepreneurship scene in my local area, and I’m always excited to see who thinks they
		have the next big idea. Meeting new people one of my favorite things, and I’m always trying to broaden my
		horizons.</p>

	<h2>What You Should Do</h2>

	<p>Drop me a line! I’m always down for a good chat, whether it’s about a business venture, new technology, or
		just this fantastic Earl Grey you found. You can find my contact info
		<a href="https://yashukla.github.io/contact">here</a>.</p>
