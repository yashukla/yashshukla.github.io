	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>Hi there, I'm Yash. </p>
	
	<h2>What I’m Up To</h2>

	<p>I’m a student at the University of Saskatchewan, completing a B.Eng in Engineering Physics and a B.Sc in Computer Science.Aside from classes, I’m also involved with our university’s biomedical engineering group, <a href="http://www.saskinvent.ca">SaskInvent</a> as Project Leader and Recruitment Director. I’ve worked in several research labs, spanning biochemistry, computer science, engineering, and physics. Currently, I’m doing summer research in the <a href="http://madmuc.usask.ca/">MADMUC Lab</a>, and I also work part-time at <a href="https://research.usask.ca/innovation-enterprise/">Innovation Enterprise</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>What I Do for Fun</h2>
	
	<p>Outside of school, I enjoy music, yoga, games, and a good cup of tea. I like to keep up with the innovation and entrepreneurship scene in Saskatoon, and I’m always excited to see who thinks they have the next big idea. Meeting new people one of my favorite things, and I’m always trying to broaden my horizons.</p>

	<h2>What You Should Do</h2>
	
	<p>Drop me a line! I’m always down for a good chat, whether it’s about a business venture, new technology, or just this fantastic Earl Grey you found. You can find my contact info <a href="https://yashukla.github.io/contact">here</a>.</p>
